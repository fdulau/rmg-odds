NAME
    OddsConverter

SYNOPSIS
        my $oc = OddsConverter->new(probability => 0.5);
        print $oc->decimal;    # '2.00' (always to 2 decimal places)
        print $oc->roi;             # '100%' (always whole numbers or 'Inf.')

METHODS
    new()
        Instanciate a new OddsConverter object a parameter is needed to
        start the conversion.

        List of possible parameters:
            *probability*
            *fractional*
            *decimal*
            *win_break*
            *moneyline*
            *roi*

            Example:

                    my $oc = OddsConverter->new( probability => 0.5 );

    decimal
        Without parameter, return the decimal odds for the object
        instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->decimal . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that
        decimal value and return the new decimal odds value.

        Example:

                print $oc->decimal( 3 ) . "\n";
        
    roi Without parameter, return the roi ( return on investment ) for the
        object instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->roi . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that roi
        value and return the new roi value.

        Example:

                print $oc->roi( 50 ) . "\n";
                
    fractional
        Without parameter, return the fractional odds for the object
        instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->fractional . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that
        fractional odds value and return the new fractional odds value

        Example:

                print $oc->fractional( 50 ) . "\n";
                        
    win_break
        Without parameter, return the win to break even odds for the object
        instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->win_break . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that
        win_break odds value and return the new win to break odds value

        Example:

                print $oc->win_break( 90 ) . "\n";
                        
    probability
        Without parameter, return the probability odds for the object
        instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->probability . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that
        probability odds value and return the new win to probability odds
        value

        Example:

                print $oc->probability( 90 ) . "\n";            
        
    moneyline
        Without parameter, return the moneyline odds for the object
        instantiate with the parameter from the method new()

        Example:

                print $oc->moneyline . "\n";
        
        With a parameter, re-initialise the object instance with that
        moneyline odds value and return the new win to moneyline odds value

        Example:

                print $oc->moneyline( 90 ) . "\n";

            use OddsConverter;

            my $p = 0.5;
